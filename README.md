# Recommended Tools:

## [pyFuzz](https://github.com/AyoobAli/pyfuzz) v1.1.0

I've built this tool for my own use to help me while doing a pentest on web applications. I've added multiple lists based on the type of application you are testing (Ex.: PHP, ASP, SharePoint, etc...).

A uniq feature in this tool is, it allows you to execute a custom command on each found result. For example you can pass the found URL's to another tool to do further scanning, or you can pass the Body of the found page to another tool to do further analysis.

More examples can be found in the [Repository Page](https://github.com/AyoobAli/pyfuzz#usage).


## [TCPing](https://github.com/AyoobAli/TCPing) v0.2.2 (Beta)

TCPing is a tool that allows you to use a TCP connection to ping a service. It can be used as a replacement of ICMP Ping in case the network doesn't allow ICMP, or as a service live check.

The tool also allows you to excute a custom command when the status of the service changes, for example run a command to send SMS when the service is down/up.

More examples can be found in the [Repository Page](https://github.com/AyoobAli/TCPing#usage).
