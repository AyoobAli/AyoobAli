# Recommended Tools:

## [pyFuzz](https://github.com/AyoobAli/pyfuzz)

I've built this tool for my own use to help me while doing a pentest on web applications. I've added multiple lists based on the type of application you are testing (Ex.: PHP, ASP, SharePoint, etc...).

A uniq feature in this tool is, it allows you to execute a custom command on each found result. For example you can pass the found URL's to another tool to do further scanning, or you can pass the Body of the found page to another tool to do further analysis.

More examples can be found in the [Repository Page](https://github.com/AyoobAli/pyfuzz#usage).
